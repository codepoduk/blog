This README replaces the setup How-To orginally provided by [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) when it was forked. 

# Code Pod Blog

This github pages version of the blog is a temporary measure until a final platform for the group blog is settled upon. At the time of writing we expect that to be one integrated with the website.

For the timebeing, Jekyll and github pages lets us publish blog posts quickly and provides an archive of content which can be migrated when appropriate.

# Jekyll

...is a well-known method for publishing static websites, especially blogs. It has a lot of flexibility and there's no need to recap those features here. Check out the [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information.

For Code Pod purposes, using Jekyll will reinforce baseline webdev capabilities like using github to collaborate, writing in markdown, etc.

Changing the blog's styling or functionality is relatively straightforward and ought to provide some level of challenge for an advanced beginner while being very achievable. 

# Publishing

There is an intention that any code pod members who wish to contribute to the blog can do so.

Publishing posts is as simple as pushing a correctly formatted `.md` file to the repo's `_posts` directory. 

# Content

This guide will no doubt be updated with more specific guidance on content in due course. For now, the expectation is the blog is code pod's 'conversation with itself'. It was created with the intention that the group's activities be recorded in a semi-formal fashion so that members and potential members can see what code pod is about. 

eg

- overviews of meetups
- 'state of the group' reviews
- games
- design
- data analysis
- resource recommendations
- ???
