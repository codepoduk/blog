Maybe it's appropriate that I should be the only person attending the meetup on Independence Day! Well, that's not *strictly* true...

[Gary](https://github.com/GarySiu/garysiu.github.io) turned up late in the afternoon and tried to help me with my almost-there-but-fatally-flawed [exact change](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/exact-change) solution, but it was too far gone. 

Not much else to report today. I hope Gary will continue to attend the meetups - they are usually better attended!
