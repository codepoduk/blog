You wait weeks to see some new faces at the meetups, then 4 show up at once! It was a reasonablt gentle start to the meetup. [Dan](https://github.com/danmarcus111) and [I](https://github.com/spitchell) were both there early to try to get some work done because the meetups are great for, well, meeting up, but less so for actually producing functional code!

## Disposable Hardware
Dan had mentioned last week that he intended to set up a home server using a [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), so I had a root around in my hardware drawer for spares and found I had even more unutilised pis than than I thought!

I kept ahold of the raspberry pi 0 and the model A (sentimental value), but was happy for Dan to take the B+ if he can put it to good use. Maybe I can persuade him to do a post on here describing his experience of getting it up and running...

## Lunch 
Dan and I grabbed a burrito at Freebird in the [Shoreditch Food Village](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/246296826/shoreditch-food-village/) around the corner from ([Citizen M](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/246296826/shoreditch-food-village/)), which was very tasty and much needed. 

It might be an idea to arrange to go there after one of the meetups for a more socially focused get-together. 

Summer will be gone before we know it, so bring it up if that sounds like something you'd be interested in!

## Busy afternoon
In the afternoon we were joined by first-time attendee [Linda](https://github.com/ilonze) who's working on a library (like, book library) app in react. Linda also has a keen interest in blockchain technology and there was some lively discussion of [bitcoin and ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) that drifted on to the [wider applicability of blockchains](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/blockchain-is-our-first-22nd-century-technology-d4ad45fca2ce) including a social network ([steemit](https://steemit.com/)) - which I haven't had time to look into yet, but there's the link if you want to check it out!

While I continued to flounder around with wireframing tools and `@media` rules, we were joined by [Rahul](https://github.com/rkadam21) and Sam (still a man of mystery). 

And the new faces kept coming - Tano, Ru (Roo? Rhu?), I think a chap called Alex showed up after I left. Phew! I feel like I'm still missing someone else. 

So I don't know what other conversations were had while I was discussing monkey socialism with Rahul and PHP alternatives with Sam, but I'm sure they were equally fascinating!

Hope to see new attendees back next week or in the [slack channel](https://code-pod-signup.herokuapp.com/).
